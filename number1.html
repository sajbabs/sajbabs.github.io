            Short Story of My Life
        </h1>
        <p>
            //first paragraph
            I am AJIBOLA SULAIMAN, welcome to my page. I am an Masters of Software Development student of Mahrishi International University. <br>
            I am IT personnel with over 8years experience. My interest in the information technology field, or more commonly known as the 
            IT industry, began in my early teenage years in Nigeria. I was curious about how computers perform the multitude of operations
            they do, and this led me to attend a computer technician training program after graduating high school at the age of 15. <br>

            //second paragraph
            Following my training, I worked as a technician for a while, fixing and building computer hardware. It was fun but it only showed me 
            how computers are assembled and led me to understand that programs and software allow us to communicate with machines. <br>
            After moving to the United States, I learned there is more knowledge to be gained in this industry which can be acquired through the
            Masters degree program at MAharishi International University.<br> Although I hope to gain employment and help improve development in this field soon,
            in the future my goal is to someday become a tech entrepreneur and advocate and to employ others.
